# Huffman-Coding-in-Lisp

In this project, the Huffman coding algorithm, which is a divide and conquer approach, is used to encode a message into binary code and decode the binary back to the original message. In order to achieve this, a Huffman Tree is constructed using the frequency list of the content of the message. Generating the frequency list requires counting the occurrence of each symbol (or its weight) in the original message and pair each count with its corresponding symbol. After this first phase, every pair is put in a list and the entire list in a list itself; then sort the whole thing in increasing order of weight. This way, we now have a list of Huffman sub-trees (sub-htrees). The objective is to compress data using variable length coding rather than fixed length coding all in a lossless manner.
